    description: "The first generation Lexus GX (GX 470) was introduced as a mid-size luxury SUV positioned between the RX and LX in the Lexus lineup. Based on the international Toyota Land Cruiser Prado platform, it combined genuine off-road capability with Lexus luxury. Powered by a 4.7-liter V8 engine initially producing 235 horsepower (later increased to 263 hp in 2005), paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive with a dual-range transfer case. Notable features included adaptive variable suspension, adjustable height control, downhill assist control, and hill-start assist control. The interior offered three rows of seating for up to eight passengers, trimmed with premium leather and wood accents. Luxury amenities included a Mark Levinson premium audio system, DVD-based navigation, and rear seat entertainment options. The GX 470 featured body-on-frame construction with an independent front suspension and solid rear axle with air springs, balancing off-road articulation with on-road comfort. A 2004 Sport package added unique wheels and roof rack, while a 2008 refresh brought styling updates and additional features. The first generation GX established the model's reputation for combining traditional SUV capability with Lexus luxury and reliability."

    end_year: 2023
    description: "The second generation Lexus GX (GX 460) continued the model's focus on combining luxury with genuine off-road capability. Based on the revised Toyota Land Cruiser Prado platform, it featured more angular styling with Lexus's signature spindle grille (more pronounced after the 2014 refresh). Powered by a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 301 horsepower (later reduced to 292 hp with switching to SAE net ratings) paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The full-time four-wheel drive system included a Torsen limited-slip center differential and a dual-range transfer case. Advanced off-road technology included Crawl Control (a low-speed off-road cruise control), Downhill Assist Control, and Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System that could disconnect the stabilizer bars for improved articulation. The interior featured three rows of seating for seven passengers, with premium leather, wood trim, and modern technology including an available Mark Levinson surround-sound system and wide-view front and side cameras. Safety technology expanded significantly over the generation, eventually including Lexus Safety System+ as standard with pre-collision system, lane departure alert, intelligent high beams, and high-speed dynamic radar cruise control. A significant refresh in 2020 brought an even more pronounced spindle grille, standard triple-beam LED headlights, and updated technology features. Despite minimal changes throughout its long production run, the second generation GX maintained a loyal following for its combination of luxury, reliability, and authentic off-road capability increasingly rare in the luxury SUV segment."

    description: "The third generation Lexus GX represents a comprehensive redesign while maintaining the model's fundamental body-on-frame construction and off-road focus. Based on Lexus's new GA-F platform shared with the Toyota Land Cruiser, it features a bold, squared-off design with a distinctive interpretation of the Lexus spindle grille, prominent fender flares, and an available blacked-out Overtrail package for a more rugged appearance. Power comes from a new twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V6 engine producing 349 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque (a significant increase over the previous V8), paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and full-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case. Advanced off-road technology includes Multi-Terrain Select, Crawl Control, Downhill Assist Control, and an available electronic-disconnect front stabilizer bar. The interior offers a significant upgrade with a modern digital cockpit featuring a 14-inch touchscreen, 12.3-inch digital instrument display, and available head-up display. Available in six or seven-passenger configurations with enhanced second-row comfort and accessibility. Luxury features include semi-aniline leather, massaging front seats, open-pore wood trim, and a 21-speaker Mark Levinson Reference surround sound system. The new platform enhances both on-road comfort and off-road capability, with improved approach, departure, and breakover angles compared to the previous generation. Advanced safety features come standard through Lexus Safety System+ 3.0. The third generation GX maintains its position as a technically capable off-roader with premium luxury appointments, now with modernized design, technology, and significantly improved performance and efficiency."
